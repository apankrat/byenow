# Byenow

This is the source code of the **byenow** program, a multithreaded folder removal utility for Windows.

The source depends on several libraries that are not included in this distribution and that aren't currently public. 
They are however fairly simple wrappers around Win32 API and their functionality should be fairly obvious from their usage.
